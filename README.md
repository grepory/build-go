# go-build

go-build is a reusable container for building Go projects that use gb. In an
effort to standardize the build process, it makes a few simple of assumptions.

* You are using gb.
* You have all of your vendor packages already.
* You require that all tests be passing in order to build.

## Building with go-build

NOTE: until we move to Go 1.5, we do not support cross-compilation so specifying TARGETS won't
do you any good. We're only compiling to linux/amd64 at the moment.

```
docker pull quay.io/opsee/go-build
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/build -e "TARGETS=linux/amd64 darwin/amd64" quay.io/opsee/go-build
```

Resulting binaries and packages will end up in:

* `target/`
  * `linux/`
    * `x86_64/`
      * `bin/`
      * `pkg/`
  * `darwin/`
    * `x86_64/`
      * `bin/`
      * `pkg/`
